                <h2>Greenhouse gas emissions and advanced green technologies</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Developing Canada's minerals sector in clean and sustainable ways will ensure that it can continue to contribute to the Canadian economy for years to come.
                
                    Greenhouse gas emissions: 
                    Canadian mines have relatively low intensities of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across a range of commodities. Canada's carbon competitiveness stems from a host of advantages, including access to clean energy sources and significant investments in research, development and adoption of green technologies. Canadian mines and processing facilities continue to invest to lower their emissions through electrification of equipment and vehicle fleets and through the development of new technologies. This includes mines in remote off-grid locations that have few alternative energy sources. Some of these remote sites have chosen to install wind turbines to reduce their dependency on diesel fuel.
                
                    Advanced green technologies: 
                    The Green Mining Initiative, led by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), aims to further improve the minerals sector's environmental performance and create green technology opportunities. NRCan works in close partnership with provincial and territorial governments, industry, academia, non-governmental organizations and other interested stakeholders, such as the Canada Mining Innovation Council.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Canada is the global leader in the production of potash and ranks among the top five global producers for diamonds, gemstones, gold, indium, niobium, platinum group metals, titanium concentrate and uranium.
                        
                    Canada is also the world's fourth-largest primary aluminum producer.

                <h2>Mineral exploration</h2>
                <hr>
                    <p>
                        Mineral exploration is the search for materials in the Earth's crust, where concentration and quantity allow for extraction and processing at a profit.

                        Key facts
                        Preliminary figures for 2021 indicate that mining and mineral exploration companies spent $3.6 billion on exploration and deposit appraisal projects in Canada, compared with $2.2 billion in 2020.
                        2022 expenditures are expected to rise to $3.7 billion - an increase of about 3%, based on reported spending intentions (si).
                        Exploration and mining companies that have their headquarters in Canada accounted for the largest portion of worldwide non-ferrous exploration budgets, reaching 38% in 2021.
                        Canada was among the world's top destinations for non-ferrous mineral exploration in 2021, attracting 19% of global exploration budgets.
                        The amount spent on mineral exploration and on deposit appraisal activity depends largely on market conditions and commodity prices. Over the last decade, mineral and metal prices fluctuated significantly, reaching a cyclical peak in 2011 that was driven by rapid growth in China and other emerging market economies. Prices subsequently decreased as supply outpaced demand.

                        Prices began to recover later in 2016, a trend that continued into the last half of 2019, but shifted for most metals in early 2020 because of the economic lockdowns implemented in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. Metal prices recovered later in 2020 as supply diminished and demand recovered. In 2021 and in the first half of 2022, the pace of the growth in price intensified as a result of rising inflationary pressures and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

                <h2>Indigenous employment</h2>
                <hr>
                    <p>Based on the 2016 census, over 16,500 Indigenous people were employed in Canada's mining and mineral processing industries. Over half of the Indigenous employment was in the upstream mining subsector, where Indigenous people accounted for 12% of the industry's labour force, more than double the all-industry average representation of 4% and up from 8% in 2011. Census 2021 data are expected to be released by Statistics Canada in the fall of 2022.</p>

                <h2>Agreements between companies and Indigenous peoples</h2>
                <hr>
                    <p>
                        Agreements between mineral exploration and mining companies and Indigenous communities or governments have helped secure benefits for many Indigenous communities and businesses and improved certainty for exploration and mining companies. Fostering the relationship between industry and Indigenous businesses builds the capacity for Indigenous businesses to capitalize on economic opportunities happening in or near their communities. It also allows industry to create reliable, local supply chains and the social licence to operate in a community.
            
                        More than 586 agreements (active and expired agreements at the exploration, development and post-development stages) for 385 exploration and mining projects, have been signed since 1974. Approximately 465 of these agreements were still active in 2021. More than half of the active agreements are in Ontario (157) and British Columbia (99). Furthermore, there has been an increase in agreements for exploration, development and post-development stages:
                
                        <li>51 prior to 2000</li>
                        <li>524 between 2000 and 2021</li>
                            
                        The increase is due to both a higher level of exploration and mining activity and a growing focus on building mutual understanding between Indigenous communities and the mining industry. However, for the past few years, there have been fewer agreements for exploration, development and post-development stages with the reduced number of projects.
