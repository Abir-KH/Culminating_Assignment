                    Forests provide a wide range of economic, social and environmental benefits. The forest sector continues to be a major contributor to Canada's economy. The sector provides income for local workers in 2,400 communities, contributes $25.2 billion to nominal GDP, supports more than 300 forest-reliant communities and directly employs more than 184,000 Canadians.
                    Canada's forests play an essential role in the economy and the lives of Canadians, including in Indigenous and rural communities. Forests sustain life by providing essential habitat, food, renewable energy and materials. They also provide important environmental services and opportunities for spiritual and cultural enrichment. The forest sector supports about 300 forest-reliant communities and directly employs 205,365 Canadians, including approximately 12,000 First Nations, Mï¿½tis and Inuit people. Forest ecosystems also provide important biodiversity habitat; supply goods and services that can drive sustainable growth; and are an essential part of the solution to climate change. Sustainably managed forests, and the wood products produced from them, provide important pathways to manage carbon and help mitigate the impacts of climate change.

                        Between 2011 and 2021, total employment fluctuated at around 200,000 jobs, with a high of just over 210,000 in 2018 and a low of under 190,000 in 2020. In 2021, the total employment increased again to over 205,000 jobs. On average, the wood product manufacturing subsector makes up the greatest share of the forest sector employment, followed by the pulp and paper product manufacturing and the in-forest activities subsectors.
